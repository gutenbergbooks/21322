<h2>THE TALE OF BETSY<br />BUTTERFLY</h2>

<h2><a name="I" id="I"></a>I</h2>
<h3>BEAUTY AND THE BLOSSOMS</h3>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Every</span> one of the field people in Pleasant
Valley, and the forest folk as well, was
different from his neighbors. For instance,
there was Jasper Jay. He was the noisiest
chap for miles around. And there was
Peter Mink. Without doubt he was the
rudest and most rascally fellow in the whole
district. Then there was Freddie Firefly,
who was the brightest youngster on the
farm&mdash;at least after dark, when his light
flashed across the meadow.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_2" id="p_2">p. 2</a></span>So it went. One person was wiser than
any of his neighbors; another was stupider;
and somebody else was always hungrier.
But there was one who was the loveliest.
Not only was she beautiful to look upon.
She was graceful in flight as well. When
one saw her flittering among the flowers it
was hard to say which was the daintier&mdash;the
blossoms or Betsy Butterfly.</p>

<p>For that was her name. Whoever gave
it to her might have chosen a prettier one.
Betsy herself always said that she would
have preferred Violet. In the first place,
it was the name of a flower. And in the
second, her red-and-brown mottled wings
had violet tips.</p>

<p>However, a person as charming as Betsy
Butterfly did not need worry about her
name. Had she been named after a dozen
flowers she could have been no more attractive.</p>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_3" id="p_3">p. 3</a></span>People often said that everybody was
happier and better just for having Betsy
Butterfly in the neighborhood. And some
claimed that even the weather couldn't
help being fine when Betsy went abroad.</p>

<p>"Why, the sun just has to smile on
her!" they would exclaim.</p>

<p>But they were really wrong about that.
The truth of the matter was that Betsy
Butterfly couldn't abide bad weather&mdash;not
even a cloudy sky. She said she didn't
enjoy flying except in the sunshine. So no
one ever saw her except on pleasant days.</p>

<p>To be sure, a few of the field people
turned up their noses at Betsy. They were
the jealous ones. And they generally pretended
that they did not consider Betsy
beautiful at all.</p>

<p>"She has too much color," Mehitable
Moth remarked one day to Mrs. Ladybug.
"Between you and me, I've an idea that it<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_4" id="p_4">p. 4</a></span>
isn't natural. I think she paints her
wings!"</p>

<p>"I don't doubt it," said Mrs. Ladybug.
"I should think she'd be ashamed of herself."
And little Mrs. Ladybug pursed up
her lips and looked very severe. And then
she declared that she didn't see how people
could say Betsy was even good-looking, if
they had ever noticed her tongue. "Honestly,
her tongue's as long as she is!" Mrs.
Ladybug gossiped. "But she knows
enough to carry it curled up like a watch-spring,
so it isn't generally seen.... You
just gaze at her closely, some day when
she's sipping nectar from a flower, and
you'll see that I know what I'm talking
about."</p>

<p>Now, some of those spiteful remarks
may have reached Betsy Butterfly's ears.
But she never paid the slightest attention
to them. When she met Mehitable Moth<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_5" id="p_5">p. 5</a></span>
or Mrs. Ladybug she always said, "How do
you do?" and "Isn't this a <i>lovely</i> day?" in
the sweetest tone you could imagine.</p>

<p>And of course there was nothing a body
could do except to agree with Betsy Butterfly.
For it was bound to be a beautiful,
bright day, or she wouldn't have been
out.</p>

<p>So even those that didn't like Betsy had
to give up trying to quarrel with her.</p>

<h3>JOHNNIE GREEN'S NET</h3>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Johnnie Green</span> was never quite happy
unless he was collecting something. One
year he went about with a hammer, chipping
a piece off almost every rock in Pleasant
Valley. And of course he gathered
birds' eggs.</p>

<p>After he tired of that he began collecting
postage stamps. Next he turned his
attention to tobacco tags, even hailing travellers
who passed the house, to ask them
whether they hadn't a "hard one," meaning
by that a tag that was hard to get.</p>

<p>When he felt quite sure that he had a
sample of every kind of tobacco tag in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_7" id="p_7">p. 7</a></span>
whole world, Johnnie Green had to think
of something else to collect. And since it
was summer, and a good time to find them,
he decided to start a collection of butterflies.</p>

<p>News spreads fast among the field
people; and almost as soon as Johnnie
Green had made up his mind about his new
collection, the whole Butterfly family knew
of it.</p>

<p>Old Mr. Crow was the one that first
learned of Johnnie's plan. And he was not
pleased, either.</p>

<p>"Butterflies!" he scoffed. "I should
think Johnnie Green might better spend
his time doing something worth while.
Butterflies, indeed! Now, if he would only
collect Crows there'd be some sense in
that!"</p>

<p>But that was before old Mr. Crow and
his neighbors understood exactly what a<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_8" id="p_8">p. 8</a></span>
collection was. And the Butterflies felt
quite proud because Johnnie Green was
going to busy himself with them.</p>

<p>Later, when the field people discovered
that collecting Butterflies meant catching
them and sticking pins through their heads,
the Butterfly family became greatly excited
and worried. And as for old Mr.
Crow, he was very glad that Johnnie had
not decided to collect him and his relations.</p>

<p>Well, if you had been in Pleasant Valley
that summer, on almost any fine day
you might have seen Johnnie Green running
about the fields or the flower garden
with a butterfly net in his hand.</p>

<p>He had made the net from a barrel hoop
and a piece of mosquito netting, to which
he nailed an old broomstick for a handle.
And for the first few days when he started
making his new collection he didn't visit<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_9" id="p_9">p. 9</a></span>
the swimming hole once. When his father
asked him to do a little work for him&mdash;such
as feeding the chickens, or leading the
old horse Ebenezer to water&mdash;Johnnie
Green was not so pleasant as he might
have been. He complained that he was
too busy to bother with the farm chores
just then.</p>

<p>But Farmer Green told him to run along
and do his work.</p>

<p>"You'll have plenty of time to play,"
said Johnnie's father.</p>

<p>The Butterfly family was sorry that
Farmer Green didn't keep his boy at work
from dawn till dark. They didn't like to
have to watch out for fear that horrid net
might swoop down upon them and catch
them. They wanted to have a good time
among the flowers without being in constant
terror of capture at the hands of
Johnnie Green.</p>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_10" id="p_10">p. 10</a></span>But, strange to say, Betsy Butterfly was
not in the least uneasy. She was so gentle
herself that she couldn't believe anybody
would harm her.</p>

<p>Little did Betsy realize that she was
really in great danger. Her fatal beauty
was sure to catch Johnnie Green's eye.
And though Betsy Butterfly did not know
it, only an accident could prevent her being
added to Johnnie Green's collection.</p>

<h2><a name="III" id="III"></a>III</h2>

<h3>A MISHAP</h3>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Except</span> for the work that his father made
him do now and then, there was only one
thing that bothered Johnnie Green in making
his collection of butterflies. The
weather was not so good as it might have
been. He soon found that there was no
use hunting for butterflies except in the
sunshine. So when a three days' rain
came, Johnnie began to wish he had
started a different sort of collection.</p>

<p>But the weather cleared at last. And
the sun came out so bright that Johnnie
fairly pulled old Ebenezer away from the
watering-trough and hustled him back to<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_12" id="p_12">p. 12</a></span>
his stall; for he was in a hurry to get to
the flower garden with his butterfly net.
As for the chickens, they had very little
food that day.</p>

<p>Once in the garden, Johnnie Green
found more butterflies than he had ever
noticed before. But as soon as he began
chasing them, they flew away to the
meadow. That is, all but Betsy Butterfly.
She said she was sure Johnnie Green
wouldn't annoy her.</p>

<p>And that was where she was wrong.
The moment he caught sight of her, with
her mottled red-and-brown wings with the
violet tips, Johnnie cried: "There's a
beauty!"</p>

<p>But Betsy Butterfly was so used to such
remarks that she paid little heed to him.
Even when he crept nearer and nearer to
her, with old dog Spot at his heels, she
did not take fright.</p>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_13" id="p_13">p. 13</a></span>With her tongue deep in a fragrant blossom
she was enjoying its delicious sweetness
when Johnnie Green, bearing his net
aloft, sprang at her.</p>

<p>When Johnnie jumped, Betsy Butterfly
started up in alarm. She had really
waited until it was too late. And if something
unexpected hadn't happened to Johnnie
Green, Betsy would surely have had a
place in his collection.</p>

<p>But luckily for her, Johnnie met with a
fall. He may have tripped on a vine. Or
his foot may have slipped on the wet
ground. Anyhow, he fell sprawling among
the flowers, dropping his precious net as
he stretched out his hands to save himself.</p>

<p>Johnnie's fall gave Betsy Butterfly her
only chance. Coiling her long tongue out
of her way, she quickly made her escape.</p>

<p>So Johnnie Green lost her. But she
was not all that he lost. A strange acci<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_14" id="p_14">p. 14</a></span>dent
happened just as he fell, for old dog
Spot leaped forward at the same time.
And, much to his surprise, Spot found his
head inside the butterfly net. The long
broomstick handle thumped him sharply
on his back. And the silly fellow took
fright at once.</p>

<p>With yelps of terror he scurried out of
the flower garden. And Johnnie picked
himself up just in time to see Spot tearing
across the meadow toward the woods.</p>

<p>"Spot! Spot! Come back!" Johnnie
Green shouted. But old Spot paid no attention
to his young master. Perhaps he
was too scared to hear him.</p>

<p>Spot wanted to get rid of that net that
covered his head. And he knew of no
better place to go than the woods where
he hoped to be able to free himself from
his odd muzzle by rubbing against a tree
or nosing among some bushes.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_15" id="p_15">p. 15</a></span>Johnnie ran a little way after him. But
when he saw Spot duck into the woods he
turned back sadly towards the house. For
all he knew, old Spot might run a mile
further before he stopped.</p>

<p>Johnnie would have to make a new net
if he wanted to catch any more butterflies
for his collection.</p>

<p>And the trouble was, he had no more
mosquito netting.</p>

<p>A good many of the field people saw old
Spot as he dashed off with the butterfly
net over his head. And they enjoyed a
hearty laugh at the strange sight.</p>

<p>As for Betsy Butterfly, she had learned
to watch out for Johnnie Green. And she
knew that another time he would have to
be twice as spry as he had shown himself,
if he expected to capture her.</p>

<p>Old Spot didn't come home till afternoon.
When he appeared at last he looked<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_16" id="p_16">p. 16</a></span>
very sheepish. He hoped no one had
noticed his fright. And he wouldn't go
near the flower garden again for a whole
week.</p>

<h3>BUSYBODIES</h3>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Little</span> Mrs. Ladybug said that she wished
Betsy Butterfly no ill luck. But she
thought that perhaps it would have been
a good thing for her if Johnnie Green had
caught her and put her in his collection.</p>

<p>On hearing that strange remark Mehitable
Moth turned quite pale. She never
wanted Johnnie Green's name mentioned
by anyone, because she lived in constant
terror for fear he might mistake her for
one of the Butterfly family and capture
her.</p>

<p>"What <i>do</i> you mean?" she asked Mrs.
Ladybug, while fat Jennie Junebug wad<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_18" id="p_18">p. 18</a></span>dled
nearer them, in order to hear everything
they said. Though Jennie was
sleepy, having stayed out very late the
night before, the promise of a bit of gossip
made her brighten up at once.</p>

<p>"I mean&mdash;" said Mrs. Ladybug&mdash;"I
mean that Johnnie Green would certainly
have brushed Betsy Butterfly before
adding her to his collection." And then,
seeing a blank look on the faces of her
hearers, she cried. "Don't tell me you
haven't noticed how untidy Betsy Butterfly
is! Can it be possible that the airs she
gives herself, and her fine manners, have
deceived you?"</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked Mehitable Moth
breathlessly. And as for Jennie Junebug,
her breath was coming so fast that she
couldn't say a word.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you exactly what I mean," Mrs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_19" id="p_19">p. 19</a></span>
Ladybug continued. "I stopped and spoke
to Betsy Butterfly this very morning. And
I stepped up close to her, because I wanted
to see if she really does paint her wings, as
my friend Miss Moth, here, suspects," Mrs.
Ladybug explained to Jennie Junebug.
"And what do you think? I saw that
Betsy Butterfly was <i>completely covered
with dust</i>, from head to foot!"</p>

<p>Mehitable Moth looked rather uncomfortable.
She was somewhat dusty herself.
And she thought that Mrs. Ladybug might
be giving her a sly dig.</p>

<p>"Perhaps Betsy had been on a journey,"
she ventured.</p>

<p>"Ah! But there is no dust to-day, on
account of the rain we had last night,"
Mrs. Ladybug replied. "I'm convinced
that the dust I saw on Betsy Butterfly
was <i>weeks old</i>."</p>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_20" id="p_20">p. 20</a></span>"The idea!" Jennie Junebug exclaimed.
"I should think she'd be ashamed of herself.
Did you tell her how untidy she
looked?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Ladybug shook her head.</p>

<p>"No!" she answered. "But I've been
thinking the matter over. And I believe
it's my duty to speak to her about it. I
don't see what she's thinking of, to go
about looking like that!"</p>

<p>Miss Moth looked more uneasy than
ever, especially when Mrs. Ladybug said:</p>

<p>"Wouldn't you like to come with me
while I look for Betsy?"</p>

<p>"I must go home now, thank you!" said
Mehitable. And she hurried away without
another word.</p>

<p>But Jennie Junebug spoke up at once
and said she would be delighted to accompany
Mrs. Ladybug.</p>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_21" id="p_21">p. 21</a></span>"Really," Jennie confided to her companion,
"it's a good thing to have backs as
hard and slippery as yours and mine. For
the dust can't stick to us as it does to
some."</p>

<p>"There's no excuse for not keeping oneself
neat," Mrs. Ladybug said severely.
"And I shall give Betsy Butterfly a piece
of my mind."</p>

<h3>NO JOKER</h3>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Much</span> to Mrs. Ladybug's surprise, she did
not find Betsy Butterfly in the flower
garden.</p>

<p>"It's too bad she's not here," Mrs. Ladybug
remarked to her friend Jennie Junebug,
who accompanied her. "We'll have
to look in the meadow. And it may take
a long time to find Betsy there."</p>

<p>Jennie Junebug yawned right in Mrs.
Ladybug's face.</p>

<p>"Then I can't come with you," she said.
"I'm getting terribly sleepy again. And
since I expect to be up all night, I'm going
to take a nap."</p>

<p>Mrs. Ladybug looked at Jennie with<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_23" id="p_23">p. 23</a></span>
great disapproval as that fat young person
crept under a leaf and went to sleep.</p>

<p>"Things have come to a pretty pass
when ladies stay out all night!" she muttered.
"It was not that way when I was
a girl. But times have changed for the
worse."</p>

<p>The longer Mrs. Ladybug stared at her
sleeping friend, the more she thought that
she ought to wake her up. "If I rouse her
she'll be so drowsy to-night that she'll
simply have to go to bed," Mrs. Ladybug
thought.</p>

<p>So she poked Jennie Junebug several
times.</p>

<p>But Jennie Junebug only stirred
slightly and murmured something in her
sleep.</p>

<p>And seeing that it was useless to try to
awaken her Mrs. Ladybug set out for the
meadow alone.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_24" id="p_24">p. 24</a></span>The sun hung low in the west when Mrs.
Ladybug found Betsy Butterfly among a
clump of milk-weed blossoms. But Mrs.
Ladybug did not care what time it was.
She was satisfied when she saw that Betsy
was just as dusty as ever. For, to tell
the truth, little Mrs. Ladybug was so
jealous of the beautiful Betsy that she
<i>wanted</i> to say something disagreeable to
her.</p>

<p>"Hasn't this been a lovely day?" Betsy
Butterfly cried happily, as soon as she
noticed Mrs. Ladybug. "I've enjoyed
every moment of it. Ever since I saw you
in the flower garden this morning I've been
here in the meadow, flitting from one
blossom to another."</p>

<p>"You might better have spent a little of
your time in a different way," Mrs. Ladybug
remarked with a frown.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_25" id="p_25">p. 25</a></span>Betsy Butterfly looked up in surprise,
withdrawing her long tongue from the blossom
in which she had just buried it.</p>

<p>"<i>Ugh!</i>" A shudder shook prim Mrs.
Ladybug. "Please coil your tongue!" she
begged. "I can't bear the sight of it. But
I must say that I ought not to expect
good manners in a person who goes about
looking as untidy as you do."</p>

<p>Betsy Butterfly laughed gaily.</p>

<p>"I didn't know you were such a joker!"
she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm not joking," Mrs. Ladybug
said. "I mean every word I say."</p>

<p>"Then I wouldn't talk so much, if I were
you," Betsy Butterfly advised her with a
merry twinkle in her eye. And before
Mrs. Ladybug could say another word
Betsy Butterfly flew away and left her
spluttering and choking.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_26" id="p_26">p. 26</a></span>"She insulted me!" Mrs. Ladybug
screamed, as soon as she was able to speak.
"She insulted me. And then she hurried
off because she didn't dare stay!"</p>

<p>But Mrs. Ladybug was mistaken about
one thing. Betsy Butterfly knew that she
had just time to reach home before sunset.
So that was why she left so suddenly. For
she never was willing to travel when the
sun was not shining.</p>

<p>"I'll see Betsy in the morning," Mrs.
Ladybug promised herself savagely. "I'll
make it my business to follow her everywhere
she goes, until I've given her a good
talking to."</p>

<h3>MRS. LADYBUG'S ADVICE</h3>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Little</span> did Betsy Butterfly guess what
Mrs. Ladybug intended to say to her. And
if she had known what it was she would
have been merely amused. For Betsy was
entirely too sweet-tempered to take offense
at anybody's fault-finding&mdash;least of all that
of Mrs. Ladybug, who was really a good-hearted
soul, when she wasn't jealous.
And when Betsy went to the flower garden
early the next morning she felt kindly towards
the whole world, not even excepting
Johnnie Green, though he had tried to capture
her.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_28" id="p_28">p. 28</a></span>Well, Mrs. Ladybug was waiting for
Betsy Butterfly among the flowers. She
had been in such haste to reach the garden
early that she had not stopped to have her
breakfast. And like many people who have
not drunk their morning cup of coffee, she
was in a very peevish mood.</p>

<p>"Now, Miss Pert, I want you to listen to
me!" That was Mrs. Ladybug's greeting
to Betsy Butterfly on one of the most delightful
days of the whole summer. "It's
my unpleasant duty&mdash;" said Mrs. Ladybug,
who by that time was enjoying herself
thoroughly&mdash;"it's my unpleasant
duty to tell you that people are talking
about you. They say that you're going
about <i>covered with dust</i>! And as a friend,
I advise you to give yourself a thorough
brushing each morning, and as often thereafter
as may be necessary."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_29" id="p_29">p. 29</a></span>Betsy Butterfly had listened in amazement
to Mrs. Ladybug's words. And she
had hard work not to laugh, too, because
she thought Mrs. Ladybug's advice decidedly
funny.</p>

<p>"Thank you very much!" Betsy said
most politely. "I'll remember what you've
told me."</p>

<p>Somehow Mrs. Ladybug thought that
Betsy meant she would follow her advice.
And she looked quite pleased.</p>

<p>"I shall expect a great improvement in
your appearance the next time I see you,"
she announced. And with the manner of
a person who has just done somebody a
good turn she hurried away to get the
breakfast that was waiting for her, somewhere.</p>

<p>Then Betsy Butterfly enjoyed a good
laugh.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_30" id="p_30">p. 30</a></span>"How ridiculous!" she said to herself.
"But I won't tell Mrs. Ladybug of her
mistake, because she might feel upset if I
did." And you can see, just by that, how
kind-hearted Betsy was. She did not even
tell her own family about the joke, for
fear of hurting Mrs. Ladybug's feelings.</p>

<p>But jealous little Mrs. Ladybug had no
such misgivings. <i>She</i> went out of her way
to explain to people that if they noticed a
change in Betsy Butterfly's appearance,
they might thank <i>her</i> for it.... "I told
Betsy that she ought to brush the dust off
herself," she informed her friends.</p>

<p>Naturally she was displeased when she
met Betsy that very afternoon and saw
that the dust still lay thick on her wings.</p>

<p>"I believe you actually want to be untidy!"
Mrs. Ladybug cried. "And if you
aren't going to brush that dust off, I shall<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_31" id="p_31">p. 31</a></span>
do it myself!" And grasping a small Indian
paint-brush, the weight of which she
could scarcely stagger under, Mrs. Ladybug
advanced upon Betsy Butterfly with
a determined look in her eye.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't do that!" cried Betsy.</p>

<p>"It's my painful duty to give you a
thorough dusting," Mrs. Ladybug declared.</p>

<h3>BUTTERFLY BILL</h3>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Now</span>, a crowd had gathered quickly
around Betsy Butterfly and Mrs. Ladybug;
for the field people are quick to
notice anything unusual. And a sprightly
young cousin of Betsy's known as Butterfly
Bill said to Mrs. Ladybug, with a wink
at everybody else:</p>

<p>"I suppose you'll dust the rest of us,
too?"</p>

<p>"Only those that need it!" replied Mrs.
Ladybug.</p>

<p>"Then you'll have your hands full,"
Butterfly Bill told her. "Maybe you<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_33" id="p_33">p. 33</a></span>
haven't noticed that every member of the
Butterfly family in Pleasant Valley is
covered with dust just as Betsy is."</p>

<p>Mrs. Ladybug looked surprised.</p>

<p>"Is that so?" she said faintly.</p>

<p>"It certainly is!" Bill cried. "Maybe
you never knew that the dust is what
gives us our&mdash;<i>ahem</i>&mdash;our beautiful colors,"
he added proudly. "And I warn
you that if you so much as touch my
lovely cousin with that brush you'll have
every one of us fellows in your hair."</p>

<p>Of course poor Mrs. Ladybug was quite
bald. But she knew what Butterfly Bill
meant. And she was so upset that she
promptly let the paint-brush fall to the
ground.</p>

<p>Then Betsy's cousin nodded approvingly.</p>

<p>"Now you'd better hurry home," he told
Mrs. Ladybug. "There's a rumor around
the meadow that your house is on fire.<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_34" id="p_34">p. 34</a></span>
And they say your children are in great
danger."</p>

<p>Little Mrs. Ladybug at once fell to
weeping.</p>

<p>"It's that horrid Freddie Firefly!" she
shrieked. "I've told him to keep away
from my home. I've told him that he
would set it to blazing with that light of
his. But he's forever sneaking around
my house as soon as my back is turned."</p>

<p>"There, there! Don't be frightened!"
Betsy Butterfly said to her soothingly.
"It's only a rumor, you know."</p>

<p>"That's so," Mrs. Ladybug admitted,
drying her eyes. "I hear it almost every
day, too. But I never can get used to
it.... I suppose this is only a false
alarm, after all."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't be so sure about that," Butterfly
Bill said wickedly, with a shake of
his head. "And if I were you I'd look<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_35" id="p_35">p. 35</a></span>
after my own family a little more carefully,
instead of troubling myself with
other people's affairs."</p>

<p>Several of Bill's friends applauded his
speech. But Betsy Butterfly whispered
to him to hush.</p>

<p>"Don't you see that Mrs. Ladybug is
not quite herself?" she asked him.</p>

<p>But Butterfly Bill was not a person to
be easily silenced like that.</p>

<p>"She's a meddling busybody!" he declared.
"And it's my opinion that she
ought to be put where she'll have to mind
her own business."</p>

<p>"Who&mdash;me?" called a wheezing voice
right in his ear.</p>

<p>Turning, Butterfly Bill saw that it was
Jennie Junebug who had spoken to him.
She had noticed the crowd from a distance.
And she had just arrived, quite
out of breath.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_36" id="p_36">p. 36</a></span>Before Betsy Butterfly's cousin Bill
could answer, Jennie Junebug actually
threatened him.</p>

<p>"If you were talking about me I shall
have to knock you down," she declared.</p>

<p>He had heard that Jennie delighted in
flying <i>bang</i> into anybody. But he did
not know that she indulged in that unladylike
trick <i>only after dark</i>.</p>

<p>"Of course I didn't mean you!" he said
hastily.</p>

<p>"And I hope you didn't mean my
friend Mrs. Ladybug, either," Jennie Junebug
added. "For if you did&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Butterfly Bill waited to hear no
more. Thoroughly frightened, he sought
safety in flight. And as he flew away Mrs.
Ladybug couldn't help noticing the dust
on his wings.</p>

<p>"They're certainly a peculiar lot&mdash;that
Butterfly family!" she muttered.</p>

<h3>DO YOU LIKE BUTTER?</h3>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">After</span> Mrs. Ladybug failed in her attempt
to brush the dust off Betsy Butterfly
she grew more jealous of Betsy than
ever.</p>

<p>It was really a shame that Mrs. Ladybug
should feel like that. Usually she was
quite harmless, even if she was a busybody
and a gossip. But she simply couldn't
forgive Betsy Butterfly for being so beautiful.
And now Mrs. Ladybug began to
neglect her children more than ever, in
order to spy upon Betsy in the hope of
discovering some new fault in her.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_38" id="p_38">p. 38</a></span>Betsy Butterfly soon noticed that wherever
she went she was sure to see Mrs.
Ladybug, who had a way of bobbing up
in a most startling fashion. But Betsy
was always quite polite to the jealous
little creature. And she never failed to
inquire for her health and that of her
children as well, even if she met Mrs.
Ladybug a dozen times a day.</p>

<p>For some reason Mrs. Ladybug seemed
quite touchy, where her family was concerned.</p>

<p>"You don't need to ask about my children,"
she told Betsy at last in a somewhat
sharp tone. "They are in the best of
health. And I'll let you know in case they
fall ill.... It's strange," she continued,
"how everybody in this neighborhood is
always prying into my household affairs."</p>

<p>Betsy Butterfly smiled to herself. She
did not care to quarrel with Mrs. Ladybug<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_39" id="p_39">p. 39</a></span>
&mdash;nor with anyone else, for that matter.
So she abruptly changed the subject.</p>

<p>"Do you like butter?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Why, no!" said Mrs. Ladybug. "I
don't care anything about it. At least, I
never ate any."</p>

<p>"Then I don't see how you know whether
you like it or not," Betsy observed, "unless
you've looked into a buttercup to find
out."</p>

<p>Mrs. Ladybug was interested, in spite of
herself.</p>

<p>"Can a person tell by doing that?" she
wanted to know.</p>

<p>"It's a sure way," said Betsy Butterfly.
"I was just looking into this buttercup
that I'm sitting on when you flew up
and spoke to me."</p>

<p>"Do <i>you</i> like butter?" Mrs. Ladybug
inquired.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid not," Betsy told her.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_40" id="p_40">p. 40</a></span>"I'd like to try, myself," Mrs. Ladybug
exclaimed eagerly. "But I don't know
how."</p>

<p>"It's simple enough," Betsy Butterfly
replied. "You just look into a buttercup
blossom.</p>

<p>"And if it makes your face yellow, then
you're fond of butter&mdash;whether you ever
had any or not."</p>

<p>So Mrs. Ladybug perched herself on a
big blossom and peered earnestly into its
cup.</p>

<p>"Is my face yellow?" she asked Betsy.</p>

<p>"I do believe it is!" Betsy Butterfly
cried.</p>

<p>And Mrs. Ladybug looked much
pleased.</p>

<p>"I've always known I had refined
tastes," she remarked with a lofty air.
"And now I'd like to sample a bit of butter;
but I don't know where to find any."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_41" id="p_41">p. 41</a></span>"Butter? They make it at the farmhouse,"
Betsy informed her.</p>

<p>"Then perhaps Farmer Green's wife
will let me have a little," Mrs. Ladybug
said hopefully. "I'll go over to the farmhouse
at once.... It's too bad you don't
like butter, too," she added.</p>

<p>But secretly she was delighted that
Betsy Butterfly had looked into a buttercup
in vain.</p>

<h3>UNEXPECTED NEWS</h3>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Little</span> Mrs. Ladybug had a disappointment
when she reached the farmhouse. She
found, to her dismay, that she couldn't get
inside it; for wire screens blocked her way
through both doors and windows. And
nobody paid the slightest attention to her
when she stopped at the buttery window
and asked if she couldn't please have a bit
of butter.</p>

<p>There was plenty of golden butter right
there in plain sight, since it happened to
be churning day. And Farmer Green's
wife, with her sleeves rolled above her elbows,
was working busily on the other
side of the window screen.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_43" id="p_43">p. 43</a></span>"I should think she might easily spare
me a small sample!" Mrs. Ladybug cried
at last. "I'm afraid Farmer Green's wife
is stingy."</p>

<p>Mrs. Ladybug hoped that Johnnie
Green's mother would hear her remark.
But she didn't. And in the end Mrs.
Ladybug had to fly away with her longing
for butter still unsatisfied.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Betsy Butterfly had been
amusing herself in the meadow to her
heart's content. To tell the truth, it was
rather a relief to be rid of Mrs. Ladybug's
society for so long a time. And Betsy
hoped that Mrs. Ladybug's errand to the
farmhouse would keep that busybody engaged
for the rest of the day.</p>

<p>Now, after she left the farmhouse Mrs.
Ladybug set out to find Betsy Butterfly
again. But meeting Daddy Longlegs near
the stone wall, she stopped to gossip with<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_44" id="p_44">p. 44</a></span>
him, telling him how she had learned that
she liked butter, and explaining that she
had not yet tasted any.</p>

<p>"So you looked into a buttercup to find
out, eh?" said Daddy Longlegs. "I'll have
to do that, myself. Maybe I've always
liked butter, too, without knowing that I
do."</p>

<p>"You can't tell till you try," Mrs. Ladybug
remarked. "But you mustn't be too
sure. You may be disappointed. There's
Betsy Butterfly! She doesn't care for butter
at all."</p>

<p>"Are you sure about that?" Daddy
Longlegs inquired. "Really, I think you
must be mistaken, for I saw her with her
face just <i>buried</i> in butter this very day."</p>

<p>At first Mrs. Ladybug looked at him in
amazement. And then she grew very
angry.</p>

<p>"Betsy Butterfly deceived me!" she cried<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_45" id="p_45">p. 45</a></span>
in a shrill voice. "She was afraid that if
I knew she ate butter she would have to
share it with me.... I'd like to know
where she gets her butter," Mrs. Ladybug
mused.</p>

<p>"She was standing on some of Farmer
Green's, when I saw her," Daddy Longlegs
explained.</p>

<p>"Did she ask him for it?" Mrs. Ladybug
demanded.</p>

<p>"I don't believe she did," he admitted. "I
think she just took it."</p>

<p>A wicked gleam came into Mrs. Ladybug's
eyes when she learned that. And
she threw up her hands, exclaiming, "She
steals! Betsy Butterfly steals butter!
When the field people hear the news they
won't think she's so fine." And then
Mrs. Ladybug turned to Daddy Longlegs
once more and demanded whether he knew
of anything else that Betsy Butterfly was<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_46" id="p_46">p. 46</a></span>
in the habit of taking from Farmer Green.</p>

<p>"Eggs!" he replied promptly.</p>

<p>"Eggs!" Mrs. Ladybug repeated after
him. "Betsy Butterfly steals butter and
eggs!"</p>

<p>And before Daddy Longlegs could stop
her she had hurried away to spread the
news far and wide.</p>

<h3>THE NIGHT WATCH</h3>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Little</span> Mrs. Ladybug stopped everybody
she met in the meadow and related how
Betsy Butterfly was taking Farmer
Green's butter&mdash;and his eggs, too&mdash;without
asking his permission.</p>

<p>"She's going to get some of us into
trouble," Mrs. Ladybug informed her
neighbors. "Just as likely as not Farmer
Green and his wife will think others are
stealing from them. Why, I went to the
farmhouse to-day and asked for a bit of
butter. And what do you think? Mrs.
Green pretended not to hear me! I thought
it was queer, at the time. But now I know<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_48" id="p_48">p. 48</a></span>
that she's angry with me. She must have
missed some of her butter; and she thinks
I'm the guilty party." Mrs. Ladybug
shook her finger at her neighbors. "We'll
have to do something to put a stop to
Betsy Butterfly's thieving," she declared.</p>

<p>Jealous Mrs. Ladybug's story amazed all
the field people. They could scarcely believe
that anyone so beautiful and dainty
as Betsy Butterfly would bemean herself
by robbing Farmer Green&mdash;or anybody
else. But Mrs. Ladybug said that Daddy
Longlegs had <i>seen</i> Betsy with her face
buried in Farmer Green's butter. And no
one could doubt the word of so respectable
a person as Daddy Longlegs.</p>

<p>"What steps do you think we ought to
take to prevent Betsy from eating any
more butter and eggs that don't belong to
her?" asked the queen of the Bumblebee
family.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_49" id="p_49">p. 49</a></span>"I think we ought to set a careful watch
on her," said Mrs. Ladybug. "I'm sure
I don't see when she gets her stolen goods,
because I've watched her very closely myself
for some time. And I've seen her
dine on nothing but flowers."</p>

<p>"Perhaps she goes to the farmhouse at
night," Jennie Junebug suggested.</p>

<p>"That's a happy thought!" said Mrs.
Ladybug approvingly. "We'll have to get
Freddie Firefly to follow her about after
dark."</p>

<p>So Mrs. Ladybug and her neighbors
made arrangements with Freddie Firefly
to have Betsy Butterfly spied upon that
very night.</p>

<p>"I'll watch her till sunset," Mrs. Ladybug
agreed. "And then <i>you</i> must relieve
me," she told Freddie. "Don't let her out
of your sight until sunrise!" she warned
him.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_50" id="p_50">p. 50</a></span>Freddie Firefly promised that he would
be faithful to his trust. And later that afternoon,
when the sun began to drop behind
the mountains, he relieved Mrs. Ladybug,
who had been spying upon Betsy ever
since their talk earlier in the day.</p>

<p>"She's behaved herself fairly well so
far," Mrs. Ladybug whispered to Freddie,
as she prepared to fly home to her children.
"But there's no knowing when she
may start for the farmhouse. So you
mustn't take your eyes off her all night
long!"</p>

<p>"You can trust me," Freddie assured
her. And then Mrs. Ladybug said good
evening.</p>

<hr class="sorta" />

<p>Freddie Firefly always claimed that that
was the longest night he ever spent. And
he said that if he had realized that he would
have to stay in one place from sunset to<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_51" id="p_51">p. 51</a></span>
dawn he never would have agreed to watch
Betsy Butterfly.</p>

<p>For Betsy Butterfly went to sleep the
moment the sun went down. Freddie had
to remain for hours and hours where he
could flash his light upon her. And all the
while he knew that his whole family was
having a delightful time dancing in the
hollow over towards the swamp.</p>

<p>It was especially hard for Freddie because
he could see the gay lights of the
Fireflies twinkling through the dark.</p>

<p>But Betsy Butterfly knew nothing of his
long vigil. She slept and slept the whole
night long. And Freddie Firefly had to
admit to himself, as he watched her, that
she didn't <i>act</i> like a robber in the least.</p>

<h3>A SLY ONE</h3>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">When</span> Freddie Firefly reported to Mrs.
Ladybug and her neighbors that Betsy
Butterfly had taken neither butter nor
eggs from Farmer Green during the night
the field people were much puzzled.</p>

<p>"She's certainly a sly one!" Mrs. Ladybug
exclaimed. "What do you think we
ought to do now?" she asked Daddy Longlegs,
who was supposed to be very old, and
therefore very wise.</p>

<p>"I think you ought to warn her," he replied,
after some thought. "You ought to
tell Betsy Butterfly that she must stop
pilfering."</p>

<p>"No doubt your advice is good," Mrs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_53" id="p_53">p. 53</a></span>
Ladybug observed. "And I'll speak to
Betsy this very morning.... You must
come with me," she told Daddy. "I naturally
want to have a witness."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll come!" he cried in his thin,
quavering voice, though what she meant
by a "witness" was more than he knew.</p>

<p>So Mrs. Ladybug and Daddy Longlegs
set forth to find Betsy Butterfly. And behind
them followed a crowd of their neighbors.
Even lazy Buster Bumblebee joined
the procession. Though he was a drone,
and never worked, he was always ready to
exert himself for the sake of any new excitement.</p>

<p>The strange company wandered back and
forth across the meadow for some time
without finding Betsy Butterfly. But at
last Mrs. Ladybug spied her. And soon
Betsy found herself surrounded by the
mob.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_54" id="p_54">p. 54</a></span>"Goodness!" she cried, looking about her
in surprise. "How nice of you all to call
on me! I'm <i>so</i> glad to see you!"</p>

<p>Betsy Butterfly was so cordial that Mrs.
Ladybug couldn't help looking somewhat
uncomfortable. She couldn't avoid a
strange feeling of guilt. And yet she told
herself that Betsy Butterfly was really the
guilty one.</p>

<p>"She's a bold piece!" Mrs. Ladybug exclaimed,
under her breath.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you won't be so happy to see
us when you hear what we have to say to
you," Mrs. Ladybug began.</p>

<p>"There hasn't been an accident, I hope!"
Betsy cried. "Your house hasn't burned?"</p>

<p>"No!" replied Mrs. Ladybug. And again
she said, "No!" in a very decided manner.
"We've come to warn you that we've found
out about your trickery," she announced.
"We know that you like butter, and that<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_55" id="p_55">p. 55</a></span>
you're in the habit of taking it from
Farmer Green&mdash;yes! and eggs, too!"</p>

<p>"Why, I don't know what you're talking
about!" Betsy Butterfly faltered. She was
really greatly surprised.</p>

<p>"It won't help you to be untruthful,"
Mrs. Ladybug told her severely. "It's no
wonder&mdash;" she added&mdash;"it's no wonder
Mrs. Green wouldn't give me a bit of
butter when I went to the farmhouse yesterday.
She thought <i>I</i> was the one that's
been stealing it from her, right along."</p>

<p>And then Mrs. Ladybug was amazed by
what followed. For Betsy Butterfly actually
smiled at her.</p>

<p>"You're mistaken," she said. "I never
eat butter. I don't like it. And as for
eggs, how could I ever break through an
egg-shell?"</p>

<p>"I don't know anything about that,"
said Mrs. Ladybug. "And besides, I didn't<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_56" id="p_56">p. 56</a></span>
come here to be questioned," she added
tartly. "If you have any questions to ask,
just ask 'em of <i>him</i>, for he's seen you with
your face buried in butter!" And she
pointed at Daddy Longlegs.</p>

<p>And now it was <i>his</i> turn to look uncomfortable.
For he considered Betsy Butterfly
to be very beautiful indeed.</p>

<h3>A TERRIBLE BLUNDER</h3>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">When</span> the beautiful Betsy Butterfly turned
her gaze on him, Daddy Longlegs couldn't
help wishing that he had worn his new
coat that day. However, he straightened
his necktie carefully and tried to look as
well as he could.</p>

<p>"So you've seen me eating butter, have
you?" Betsy Butterfly asked him.</p>

<p>"Not <i>eating</i> it!" he corrected her. "I've
seen you <i>standing</i> on it. And your face
was hidden in it, too."</p>

<p>Mrs. Ladybug shot a triumphant glance
at the crowd, of which she and Betsy Butterfly
and Daddy Longlegs were the center.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_58" id="p_58">p. 58</a></span>"What have you to say now, my fine
lady?" she demanded of Betsy with a
sneer.</p>

<p>And still Betsy Butterfly was quite unruffled.</p>

<p>"Where did you see me doing that?" she
asked Daddy Longlegs pleasantly enough.</p>

<p>"I object!" Mrs. Ladybug interrupted
hastily. "You needn't answer her question,"
she advised Daddy Longlegs. "I know her
tricks! She'll keep us talking here until
we forget what our errand was!"</p>

<p>But Daddy Longlegs paid no attention
to Mrs. Ladybug's advice.</p>

<p>"I saw you in this meadow," he explained.</p>

<p>And Mrs. Ladybug began to look somewhat
worried.</p>

<p>"Come!" she cried. "Let's all go home
now. We've warned her; and we'll leave
her to think over what she's done....<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_59" id="p_59">p. 59</a></span>
I hope&mdash;" Mrs. Ladybug added, turning
to Betsy Butterfly&mdash;"I hope you'll decide
to turn over a new leaf."</p>

<p>"Why, that's exactly what she did, that
time when I saw her!" Daddy Longlegs
shouted. "While I was watching her I
saw her turn over a leaf. So what's the use
of her turning over another."</p>

<p>And now it was Mrs. Ladybug's turn to
look amazed and bewildered.</p>

<p>"I don't know what you're talking
about," she snapped, glaring at Daddy
Longlegs. "And I don't believe you know,
yourself."</p>

<p>"Oh! yes, I do!" he retorted shrilly.</p>

<p>"Butter has no leaves," said Mrs. Ladybug
with a knowing air. "I saw heaps and
heaps of it in Farmer Green's buttery yesterday.
And there wasn't a leaf on it."</p>

<p>"How about eggs, then?" shouted somebody
in the crowd. It was stupid Buster<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_60" id="p_60">p. 60</a></span>
Bumblebee! And of course nobody paid
any heed to his silly question.</p>

<p>As he stared at Mrs. Ladybug dully
Daddy Longlegs let his mouth fall wide
open.</p>

<p>"Why, what do you mean?" he demanded
at last. "You and I aren't talking
about the same sort of butter at all!
You're describing the kind of butter that
Mrs. Green makes at the farmhouse."</p>

<p>"And what, pray tell, have you been
talking about all this time?" Mrs. Ladybug
gasped.</p>

<p>"The butter-and-eggs in the meadow!"
Daddy Longlegs informed her. "I suppose
you know the plant, don't you?"</p>

<p>"I've heard of it," Mrs. Ladybug replied.
"But I doubt if there is such a
thing."</p>

<p>"And I say there is!" Buster Bumblebee
clamored. "We Bumblebees are very fond<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_61" id="p_61">p. 61</a></span>
of butter-and-eggs. And we're about the
only field people that know how to open
a blossom and reach its nectar."</p>

<p>Little Mrs. Ladybug waited to hear no
more.</p>

<p>"You've made a terrible blunder!" she
told Daddy Longlegs hurriedly. And before
he could answer her she had hastened
away.</p>

<p>Like many another jealous body, Mrs.
Ladybug had behaved very foolishly. And
it was no wonder that she wanted to get
away from the crowd.</p>

<p>She didn't even beg Betsy Butterfly's
pardon for calling her a thief. But all the
rest of the field people realized at last that
Betsy was no thief.</p>

<p>The butter-and-eggs plant, they were
well aware, was as free as the clover, or
the milk-weed blossoms, or any other of the
wild flowers. Everybody knew that Farmer<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_62" id="p_62">p. 62</a></span>
Green laid no claim to them, though they
did grow in his meadow.</p>

<p>And when Betsy Butterfly thanked
Daddy Longlegs for his explanation he
wished more than ever that he had worn
his new coat that day&mdash;and his new hat,
too.</p>

<h3>THE FRIENDLY STRANGER</h3>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Of</span> course, anyone so beautiful as Betsy
Butterfly was bound to attract attention.
Wherever she went people turned their
heads&mdash;if they could&mdash;to look at her. And
those whose heads were so fastened to their
bodies that they simply couldn't crane their
necks at anybody&mdash;even those unlucky
creatures wheeled themselves about in order
to gaze at Betsy.</p>

<p>If they happened to be ladies they stared
at her because they wanted to see what
was the latest style in gowns, or maybe
hats. And if they happened to be gentlemen
they looked at her because they just
couldn't help it.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_64" id="p_64">p. 64</a></span>It was no wonder, then, that Betsy Butterfly
had many admirers. In fact, she
was so accustomed to their flittering after
her that usually she paid little heed to
them. But now and then one of them made
himself so agreeable that Betsy favored
him slightly more than the others.</p>

<p>Such was a stranger dressed in yellowish
brown whom she chanced to meet
among the flowers one day. He was flying
from flower to flower with a loud
buzzing. And he reminded Betsy Butterfly
of somebody, but she couldn't just think
who it was.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said the stranger, as soon as he
caught Betsy's eye. "The blossoms are fine
and fresh after last night's shower, aren't
they?"</p>

<p>Betsy had to admit that what the
stranger said was true. And when he
came right over to the flower where she<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_65" id="p_65">p. 65</a></span>
was breakfasting and began buzzing
around her, and eating pollen, Betsy Butterfly
thought that for a stranger he
seemed very friendly.</p>

<p>She looked at him for a time, out of the
corner of her eye, while she tried to recall
whom the newcomer resembled. But he
looked like no one she had even seen. And
then all at once Betsy knew what was so
familiar about him. It was his voice!</p>

<p>"You remind me of a friend of mine,"
she remarked. "He lives in the meadow
not far from here. It's your buzzing," she
explained. "If I didn't see you I should
think you were Buster Bumblebee."</p>

<p>Betsy's remark seemed to please the
stranger. And he smiled smugly while he
buzzed louder than ever.</p>

<p>"It's not surprising that I make you
think of him," he observed. "Indeed it
would be odd if I didn't, for I'm a sort of<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_66" id="p_66">p. 66</a></span>
cousin of Buster's, so to speak. Perhaps
you didn't know that my name is Bumble&mdash;Joseph
Bumble."</p>

<p>Naturally Betsy and Joseph became
good friends on the spot. And after that
people often saw them rambling together
among the flowers.</p>

<p>Now, Joseph Bumble proved to be a
great talker. And since Betsy Butterfly
was an excellent listener, they spent many
agreeable hours together.</p>

<p>At least, Joseph enjoyed every minute
that he spent in Betsy Butterfly's company.
And if at times she found his
prattle a bit tiresome, she was too well-mannered
to say so.</p>

<p>If the truth were known, Joseph Bumble
proved to be somewhat of a braggart. He
was forever boasting of his connection with
the Bumblebee family. And Betsy couldn't
say anything to him without his remark<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_67" id="p_67">p. 67</a></span>ing
that his cousin Buster Bumblebee's
mother, the well-known Queen, thought
this or that.</p>

<p>"And being of royal blood, the Queen
ought to know what's what," he frequently
said.</p>

<p>"I suppose&mdash;" Betsy said to him at last&mdash;"I
suppose you're of royal blood yourself,
Mr. Bumble?"</p>

<p>"Oh, very!" he replied with a smirk.
"We're all of us very royal indeed."</p>

<p>And Betsy Butterfly thought how pleasant
it was to be friends with anyone who
came from such a fine family as Joseph
Bumble's.</p>

<h2><a name="XIV" id="XIV"></a>XIV</h2>

<h3>A DEEP PLOT</h3>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">As</span> time passed, Betsy continued to see a
great deal of Joseph Bumble. And she
noticed one peculiar thing: Although he
talked continually of his cousin Buster
Bumblebee, the Queen's son, no one had
ever seen the two together.</p>

<p>"How does it happen," she asked Joseph
at last, "that I never find you with your
cousin? Aren't you friends?"</p>

<p>"We're certainly not <i>enemies</i>," said Joseph
Bumble, "though I must admit that
we're not quite so intimate as we might
be. You see, Buster and I have different<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_69" id="p_69">p. 69</a></span>
tastes. And now that the red clover is in
blossom he spends all his time in the clover
field. But as you know, like you I am
very fond of flowers. And I'd far rather
be here in the meadow&mdash;or the flower garden&mdash;with
you, than in the clover patch
with Buster Bumblebee."</p>

<p>Naturally such an answer was bound to
please Betsy Butterfly. And after that she
bothered her head no more about the friendship
between the two cousins. Certainly
Joseph Bumble's explanation sounded reasonable.
And she had no cause to doubt
his statement.</p>

<p>Meanwhile there were others among
Betsy Butterfly's admirers who became
very peevish on observing how much time
Betsy and the newcomer in the neighborhood,
Joseph Bumble, were spending in
each other's society. And they agreed
among themselves that something ought to<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_70" id="p_70">p. 70</a></span>
be done to put an end to the upstart
Bumble's boasting.</p>

<p>"Betsy Butterfly thinks the fellow is a
cousin of Buster Bumblebee's," said Chirpy
Cricket. "But I've noticed that he and
Buster are never together. Let's ask Buster
to come over to the meadow so that he
may meet this cousin of his! And then
perhaps we'll learn something more about
Joseph Bumble than we know now."</p>

<p>Everybody said that that was a good
plan. And Betsy's admirers chose Daddy
Longlegs to call on Buster Bumblebee and
invite him to a party to be given in the
meadow the following day.</p>

<p>Daddy Longlegs agreed to do the errand,
in spite of the fact that for him it
was half a day's journey to the Bumblebee's
home from the stone wall where he
lived. But he thought that by hurrying
he ought to be able to get back in time to<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_71" id="p_71">p. 71</a></span>
put on his best coat and go to the party,
though he might arrive somewhat late.</p>

<p>"Don't forget to ask Betsy Butterfly to
the party!" Daddy called, as he started off
on his long trip.</p>

<p>"Don't worry! I'll attend to that myself,"
Chirpy Cricket promised.</p>

<p>"And don't forget to invite Joseph
Bumble!" Daddy cautioned him.</p>

<p>"Oh! we don't need to ask him," said
Chirpy Cricket. "<i>He'll</i> come without being
invited, unless I'm greatly mistaken."</p>

<hr class="sorta" />

<p>Luckily for Daddy Longlegs there was
not a breath of wind either that day or
the following one. So he made excellent
time to the Bumblebee home, where he
found Buster Bumblebee and gave him his
invitation. Then Daddy turned around
and started back towards his stone wall. Buster Bumblebee had promised to come to<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_72" id="p_72">p. 72</a></span>
the party. And Daddy wanted to be present
when the two cousins, Buster Bumblebee
and Joseph Bumble, met&mdash;with Betsy
Butterfly right there to watch them.</p>

<h3>JOSEPH BUMBLE'S COMPLAINT</h3>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">It</span> happened just as Chirpy Cricket had
expected. Betsy Butterfly arrived at the
party with her admirer, Joseph Bumble,
buzzing close behind her. Although he had
not been invited, he did not feel the least
bit shy about coming.</p>

<p>"Being of a royal family, I never wait
to be asked to a place," he had explained
loftily to Betsy. "And you'll see that
everybody will be glad to see me at the
party. People always consider it an honor
to have me at their entertainments."</p>

<p>Joseph's words proved partly true, anyhow.
Anyone could see that Joseph Bum<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_74" id="p_74">p. 74</a></span>ble
was more than welcome. Chirpy
Cricket and Daddy Longlegs&mdash;as well
good many others&mdash;rushed up to him and
told him how pleased they were to see him.</p>

<p>And Joseph Bumble was having a very
agreeable time talking in a loud voice
about himself and his family when he suddenly
stopped short. A look of displeasure
crossed his face. And Daddy Longlegs
asked him if he had eaten something
that disagreed with him.</p>

<p>"No!" replied Joseph Bumble. "I've
been interrupted. And it's hardly the sort
of treatment a person of royal blood&mdash;like
myself&mdash;expects to receive at a party."</p>

<p>"Who interrupted you?" Chirpy Cricket
inquired.</p>

<p>"I don't know," Joseph Bumble answered.
"But someone was talking in a
loud voice."</p>

<p>"Are you sure it wasn't yourself that<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_75" id="p_75">p. 75</a></span>
you heard?" Daddy Longlegs wanted to
know.</p>

<p>"Certainly not!" cried Joseph. "Don't
be silly! Don't you suppose I know my
own voice when I hear it?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps it was your echo that you
heard," Daddy ventured.</p>

<p>At that Joseph Bumble rudely turned
his back on him and began whispering to
Chirpy Cricket. He was actually suggesting
that Daddy Longlegs should be thrown
out of the party!</p>

<p>And then Mr. Bumble again paused
abruptly and listened.</p>

<p>"There!" he said to Chirpy Cricket.
"Don't you hear that buzzing? That's the
person that interrupted me. And I'd like
to have him put out of the party too,
along with this queer old chap who insulted
me a moment ago."</p>

<p>Chirpy Cricket looked around, until his<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_76" id="p_76">p. 76</a></span>
eye rested on Buster Bumblebee, who had
just arrived and who was at that moment
talking with Betsy Butterfly.</p>

<p>"There's the young man you hear!"
Chirpy told Joseph Bumble. "Don't you
know him?"</p>

<p>"No!" replied Joseph, as his eyes followed
Chirpy Cricket's. "And I don't
want to know him, either. He looks to me
to be a very ordinary person. And anybody
can see that he's annoying Betsy Butterfly.
I tell you, I want him chased away
from here at once. For I'm of royal
blood; and I'm not accustomed to go to
parties with ragtags and bobtails. I'm a
cousin of Buster Bumblebee, the Queen's
son."</p>

<p>Well, Chirpy Cricket tried hard not to
laugh right in Joseph Bumble's face.</p>

<p>"I'll see what I can do," Chirpy promised
him. "And I will admit that <i>some<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_77" id="p_77">p. 77</a></span>body</i>
ought to be barred out of this party."</p>

<p>"Good!" exclaimed Joseph Bumble.
"I'm glad to know that you're so sensible."</p>

<p>Perhaps he would have spoken in a different
fashion had he known exactly what
Chirpy Cricket had in mind. But now he
said nothing more, though he continued to
stare angrily at Buster Bumblebee, who
was glad to see Betsy Butterfly, and was
telling her as much, too.</p>

<h3>NOTHING BUT A FRAUD</h3>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">At</span> last Joseph Bumble's displeasure
passed all control. He began to buzz as
loud as he could, hoping to drown Buster
Bumblebee's buzzing, so that Buster
could no longer talk to Betsy Butterfly.</p>

<p>Naturally, Buster soon had to raise his
own voice, in order to make himself heard.
And soon the two made such a roar that
everybody else had to stop up his ears.</p>

<p>Noticing a look of distress on Betsy Butterfly's
face, Buster asked her what the
trouble was.</p>

<p>"You and your cousin Joseph are making
a terrible racket," she told him.</p>

<p>"My cousin Joseph!" cried Buster Bum<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_79" id="p_79">p. 79</a></span>blebee.
"And who is he, I should like to
know? Point him out to me, please! For
I didn't know I had a cousin at this
party."</p>

<p>"There he is!" said Betsy Butterfly,
nodding her head towards the glowering
Joseph.</p>

<p>"What! That unshaven stranger in the
yellowish-brown suit?" cried Buster Bumblebee.
"I assure you he's no relation of
mine."</p>

<p>"You must be mistaken," Betsy persisted.
"He says he's your cousin, and of
royal blood himself."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" cried Buster Bumblebee.
"Just let me talk to him a moment, and
I'll soon prove that your friend is nothing
but a fraud."</p>

<p>Accordingly Buster left her, and
straightway perched himself upon a daisy
directly in front of Joseph Bumble.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_80" id="p_80">p. 80</a></span>"How-dy do!" said Buster. "I hear
you've been talking about me."</p>

<p>Now, Joseph Bumble's only thought was
that the noisy chap in the yellow and black
velvet must have overheard what he had
said to Chirpy Cricket about throwing him
out of the party.</p>

<p>"I don't care to talk with you," Joseph
announced in his grandest manner. "I'm
from such a fine family that I have to be
very particular about whom I'm seen
with."</p>

<p>"Is that so?" said Buster. "I suppose
if Buster Bumblebee were at this party
you'd be glad to talk with him?"</p>

<p>"I should say I would!" was the other's
answer. "He's my cousin."</p>

<p>"What's your name, anyhow?" Buster
Inquired.</p>

<p>"Joseph Bumble!"</p>

<p>"What's the rest of it?" Buster Bum<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_81" id="p_81">p. 81</a></span>blebee
demanded, while the whole company
surged around him, so that they
might hear.</p>

<p>"I refuse to answer!" said Joseph Bumble.
And afterward Daddy Longlegs declared
that at that moment he saw the fellow's
knees trembling.</p>

<p>"Come!" said Joseph Bumble, turning
suddenly to Betsy Butterfly. "I see that
we've accidentally fallen in with some
rough people; and we'd better be moving
on."</p>

<p>But Betsy Butterfly didn't even look at
Joseph.</p>

<p>"What <i>is</i> his full name?" she asked Buster.</p>

<p>"He's a Bumble Flower-Beetle," Buster
said. "And as for his being related to me,
that's all humbug. This stranger is no
kin either to the Bumblebee or any other
Bee family. But his voice is so much like<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_82" id="p_82">p. 82</a></span>
ours that he's taken part of our name,
though our family has always claimed that
he has no right to it."</p>

<p>"Who are you?" Joseph Bumble demanded
of Buster quite fiercely. He was
determined to put his enemy to rout if he
could.</p>

<p>"I'm Buster Bumblebee!" was the reply.
"Don't you know your cousin?"</p>

<p>When he heard that, Joseph Bumble
knew at once that the game was up. His
trickery was discovered beyond a doubt.
So with one last lingering look at the beautiful
Betsy he took to his wings. And no
one ever saw him in those parts again.</p>

<p>As for Betsy Butterfly, she never could
bear, after that, to hear the name of Joseph
Bumble so much as mentioned.</p>

<h3>DUSTY'S DIFFICULTY</h3>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">It</span> was to be expected that as time went
on, Betsy Butterfly's fame would spread
far and wide. And long before the summer
was over, half the creatures that lived
in Pleasant Valley knew her. They were
the ones that went about by daylight and
rested at night.</p>

<p>As for the other half&mdash;the night-prowlers&mdash;many
of them had heard about the
beautiful Betsy, though of course they had
never seen her. That is, none of them had
set eyes on her except Freddie Firefly, who
had flashed his light upon Betsy all one
night, because Mrs. Ladybug had a strange<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_84" id="p_84">p. 84</a></span>
notion that she was stealing butter from
the farmhouse.</p>

<p>In fact, after that happened, Freddie
Firefly had gone about telling all his
friends how beautiful Betsy Butterfly was,
and saying what a pity it was that she
didn't like moonlight as well as sunshine.</p>

<p>He talked so much about her that at last
a good many of the night-prowling people
said that they wished they might see Betsy
Butterfly just once, for they could scarcely
believe that anybody could be as dainty
and bewitching as Freddie Firefly would
have them believe her.</p>

<p>And there was one dashing young chap
of the Moth family who became especially
eager to make Betsy's acquaintance. Indeed,
he began to complain that he was
losing his appetite, through thinking about
Betsy Butterfly. So he besought Freddie
Firefly to help him out of his difficulty.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_85" id="p_85">p. 85</a></span>Now, while he was talking with Freddie
Firefly, this young Moth, who was known
as Dusty, never once stopped eating. Freddie
Firefly noticed how his fat sides stuck
out.</p>

<p>And he wondered what the fellow's
appetite could have been like before he
lost some of it.</p>

<p>"You don't act like one in delicate
health," Freddie Firefly observed, as he
watched the greedy Dusty consume more
food.</p>

<p>"Oh, but I am!" Dusty Moth protested
feebly. "I'm so weak now that I can
hardly raise myself with my wings."</p>

<p>Freddie was sure that Dusty's trouble
was merely due to his being too fat. But
he saw no reason for quarreling with him.</p>

<p>"Can't you think of some plan by which
I could meet Betsy Butterfly?" Dusty
Moth persisted. "Perhaps if I could see<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_86" id="p_86">p. 86</a></span>
her just once I'd be able to get my mind
<i>off</i> her&mdash;and <i>on</i> my meals again."</p>

<p>"I don't know how I can help you,"
Freddie Firefly confessed. "You see,
Betsy goes home exactly at sunset. And
at present she never seems to make her
home in the same place for even two
nights. So one can never be sure where
she will be.</p>

<p>"Of course, when the sun is shining you
can always find her among the flowers. But
that won't help you any, because you're
such a sleepy-head in the daytime that you
couldn't see anything even if it was stuck
right into your eyes."</p>

<p>"Can't you explain my sad case to Betsy
Butterfly?" Dusty Moth asked hopefully.
"I've heard that she's very kind-hearted.
And if she knew how I'm suffering on her
account I'm sure she'd be glad to meet me
some pleasant, dark night."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_87" id="p_87">p. 87</a></span>He begged so piteously that in the end
Freddie Firefly agreed to do what he could.</p>

<p>"But I warn you&mdash;" he said&mdash;"I warn
you that I can't give you much hope."</p>

<h3>SOLOMON OWL'S IDEA</h3>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Freddie Firefly</span> actually did send a message
to Betsy Butterfly, telling her that
Dusty Moth wanted to see her, and saying
that unless she would agree to meet him
in the meadow some night soon, Dusty
was afraid he would lose his appetite entirely.</p>

<p>But Betsy thought the whole affair was
only a joke. So she merely laughed&mdash;and
sent Freddie no answer at all; for she
hardly believed that she needed to explain
to him that nothing could induce her to
stir out after sunset.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_89" id="p_89">p. 89</a></span>Freddie Firefly was much upset because
he received no answer to his message. Perhaps
he would not have cared so much had
Dusty Moth not made his life miserable
each night from dusk to dawn. But that
persistent fellow kept asking Freddie every
few minutes if he had "heard from her"
yet. And naturally anyone would grow
tired if he had to keep saying "No! no!
no!" all night long.</p>

<p>At the same time Dusty Moth kept insisting
in a most annoying way that if
he lost much more of his appetite he would
be ill, and it would be Freddie Firefly's
fault.</p>

<p>So Freddie Firefly began to worry. He
came finally to detest Dusty Moth. And
Freddie's family noticed that he was growing
quite thin, because Dusty Moth left
him little time&mdash;between questions&mdash;in
which to eat his meals comfortably.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_90" id="p_90">p. 90</a></span>"I declare, I wish Betsy Butterfly would
move away from Pleasant Valley!" Freddie
Firefly exclaimed at last, quite out of
patience with everybody and everything.
"I'm in a pretty fix, I am! And since I
don't know how to get rid of this annoying
Dusty Moth, I'm going to ask Solomon
Owl what I'd better do." That, at
least, was a comforting thought.</p>

<p>So the following morning, just before
dawn, he made what might be termed a flying
call on Solomon Owl who lived in the
hemlock woods beyond the swamp.</p>

<p>And luckily wise old Solomon thought of
a good plan at once. As soon as he had
heard Freddie Firefly's story he said to
him:</p>

<p>"If Betsy Butterfly refuses to meet your
friend, why don't you ask her for her picture?"</p>

<p>"That's a splendid idea!" Freddie cried.<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_91" id="p_91">p. 91</a></span>
"How in the world did you ever happen
to think of it, Mr. Owl?"</p>

<p>Solomon Owl hooted at that question.</p>

<p>"That's my secret," he said. "If I told
all I know, everybody else would be just
as wise as I am." And after giving another
long string of hoots, which he followed
with a burst of loud laughter, Solomon
Owl popped into his house.</p>

<p>Anyhow, Freddie Firefly couldn't complain,
for he now had a remedy for his
trouble. And he felt so carefree and happy
again that on his way across the meadow
he stopped to talk with Jimmy Rabbit,
who was taking a stroll in the direction of
Farmer Green's cabbage patch.</p>

<p>Freddie Firefly quickly told Jimmy all
about his affair with Dusty Moth. He
even explained how he had gone to ask
Solomon Owl's help, and related what that
wise bird had advised.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_92" id="p_92">p. 92</a></span>"There's only one thing that worries me
now," said Freddie Firefly anxiously. "I'm
wondering whether Betsy Butterfly has
ever had a picture made of herself."</p>

<h3>A BIT OF LUCK</h3>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Jimmy Rabbit</span> promptly set Freddie Firefly's
fears at rest.</p>

<p>"I happen to know," said he, "that Betsy
Butterfly has a picture of herself."</p>

<p>"Are you sure?" Freddie asked him eagerly.</p>

<p>"I ought to be," replied Jimmy Rabbit,
"because I painted it myself, the very next
day after I finished a portrait of old Mr.
Crow."</p>

<p>"It ought to be a good one, if you made
it," said Freddie. "But wasn't it some
time ago that you were an artist?"</p>

<p>"It was earlier in the summer," Jimmy<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_94" id="p_94">p. 94</a></span>
Rabbit admitted. "Of course, Betsy Butterfly
has changed somewhat since then.
But this picture was a fine likeness of her
at the time I painted it.... I suppose,"
he added, "I was the first one in the whole
valley to perceive that she was going to be
a beauty when she got her full growth."</p>

<p>"Do you suppose she'll send me the picture,
if I ask her, so I can show it to
Dusty Moth?" Freddie asked.</p>

<p>Jimmy Rabbit looked a bit doubtful.
He pondered for a few moments. And
then he said:</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what I'll do! To-morrow
morning I'll see Betsy and I've no doubt
that she'll loan me the picture if I promise
to return it to her."</p>

<p>"That'll be great!" cried Freddie.
"Meet me near the duck pond as soon as
it's dark to-morrow night; and be sure to
bring Betsy's picture with you!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_95" id="p_95">p. 95</a></span>Then Freddie Firefly hurried off to find
Dusty Moth, who happened likewise to be
looking for him, because he had a question
to ask.</p>

<p>They met shortly. And Dusty Moth immediately
cried:</p>

<p>"Have you heard from her?"&mdash;meaning
Betsy Butterfly, of course.</p>

<p>"Now, see here!" Freddie Firefly said.
"It's plain enough that Betsy doesn't care
to meet you. But I have a plan that
ought to suit you well enough. If you
could look at her picture once you'd be
satisfied, wouldn't you?"</p>

<p>"I would&mdash;" replied Dusty Moth&mdash;"if I
got my appetite back afterward."</p>

<p>"Well, will you promise to stop pestering
me about Betsy Butterfly if I let you
see this picture of her?"</p>

<p>"Yes! yes!" Dusty promised impatiently.
"Where is it? Quick! Let me see it!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_96" id="p_96">p. 96</a></span>"Oh! You'll have to wait till to-morrow
night," Freddie explained.</p>

<p>"I shall not be able to eat a single
mouthful till then!" Dusty Moth groaned.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;you can suit yourself about
that," Freddie told him impatiently. "And
please don't speak to me again to-night!
I've been troubled enough on your account
without being bothered by you any more."</p>

<p>"One moment!" cried Dusty, as Freddie
Firefly started to leave him.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;what do you want now?" Freddie
growled, flashing his light impatiently
in Dusty Moth's eyes.</p>

<p>"Are you sure she will let you take the
picture?" Dusty asked him.</p>

<p>"Yes! yes! Of course she will! Why
shouldn't she, I should like to know? You
certainly do ask the silliest questions!"</p>

<p>And yet Freddie Firefly had put the
same query himself, to Jimmy Rabbit, only<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_97" id="p_97">p. 97</a></span>
a short time before. But now he was
quite certain that his worries were almost
at an end.</p>

<p>"Betsy Butterfly has caused me a powerful
lot of trouble!" Freddie grumbled, as
he hurried over the hollow, to join in the
dance of the Firefly family.</p>

<h3>SOMETHING SEEMS WRONG</h3>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">When</span> Jimmy Rabbit went to see Betsy
Butterfly the next morning he found her
quite willing to let him take her picture
away with him.</p>

<p>"But I must say&mdash;" Betsy remarked&mdash;"I
must say that I don't understand why
anybody should want to borrow this old
portrait. Everyone tells me I have changed
a great deal since you made it."</p>

<p>"That's true," Jimmy Rabbit agreed.
"But the person to whom I'm going to
show it won't know the difference."</p>

<p>"I don't believe he knows me, then," she
remarked.</p>

<p>"No! And probably he never will,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_99" id="p_99">p. 99</a></span>
said Jimmy Rabbit. "But don't you worry
about that! From what I hear of him,
he's a good deal of a bore."</p>

<p>"Don't bother to bring back that picture!"
she called to Jimmy Rabbit as he
hopped away.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid Betsy Butterfly is growing
vain," he murmured to himself. "To be
sure, she <i>has</i> changed. But I shall always
like this portrait of her, because I painted
it myself."</p>

<p>Later, when he was in Farmer Green's
garden, he wrapped the picture carefully in
a rhubarb leaf and hid it beneath a pile of
brush. And he didn't come back for it
until after dark, just as the moon peeped
above the rim of the hills.</p>

<p>At the duck pond Jimmy Rabbit found
Freddie Firefly waiting for him, hopping
up and down and flashing his light through
the misty gloom.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_100" id="p_100">p. 100</a></span>"Did you get it?" Freddie demanded.</p>

<p>"It's safe in my pocket," Jimmy assured
him.</p>

<p>"Let me have it!" said Freddie. "Dusty
Moth is waiting for me at the fence-corner,
near the orchard. And I want to give
him a good look at Betsy Butterfly's picture
before the moon gets too high, for he
can't see well if there's too much light."</p>

<p>Jimmy Rabbit drew the picture carefully
from his pocket. And Freddie Firefly
took it and slung it across his back. He
fairly staggered under the weight.</p>

<p>"Aren't you going to look at Betsy's picture
yourself?" Jimmy Rabbit asked him.
"It's a good bit of work, if I do say so."</p>

<p>"Oh! I don't care about seeing it. It's
nothing to me, you know," said Freddie
carelessly. "But I hope Dusty Moth will
be satisfied with it."</p>

<p>"Well, I won't go with you, to see if he<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_101" id="p_101">p. 101</a></span>
is," Jimmy Rabbit told him. "I usually
have a light lunch at this hour. So I'll
meet you here at the duck pond after I
come back from the cabbage patch."</p>

<p>They parted then. And shortly afterward
Freddie Firefly dropped down beside
Dusty Moth, who made no attempt to conceal
his pleasure.</p>

<p>"At last!" he cried. "At last I am to
behold the beautiful Betsy Butterfly's picture!...
I do hope it's a good likeness!"
he added as he began, with trembling
hands, to unwrap the rhubarb covering
from the portrait.</p>

<p>"It certainly is," Freddie Firefly assured
him. "It was made by a friend of mine,
who once painted a famous picture of old
Mr. Crow."</p>

<p>While Freddie danced along the top of
the fence, Dusty Moth carried the picture
into the shade of an apple tree, out of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_102" id="p_102">p. 102</a></span>
moonlight, so that he might see it more
clearly.</p>

<p>A few moments later Freddie Firefly
was both surprised and alarmed to hear a
cry of anguish from the direction of the
apple tree.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" he called. "There's
nothing wrong, I hope?"</p>

<p>But Dusty Moth made no reply.</p>

<h3>A STRANGE CHANGE</h3>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Receiving</span> no answer to his question,
Freddie Firefly skipped down from the
fence and sought the shade of the apple
tree, where he found Dusty Moth staring
fixedly at Betsy Butterfly's picture.</p>

<p>Dusty's face wore a most curious look;
he seemed at once angry, sorrowful and
amazed. And not till Freddie Firefly
asked again what <i>was</i> the trouble did
Dusty Moth say a word.</p>

<p>Then he pointed scornfully toward the
portrait that Jimmy Rabbit had made
earlier in the summer.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_104" id="p_104">p. 104</a></span>"So that's the charming Betsy Butterfly,
eh?" he roared. "That's the beauty
I've heard so much about! I can tell you
right now that if I had any idea she looked
like this I never would have lost my appetite
over her!"</p>

<p>"You astonish me!" Freddie Firefly exclaimed.
"Have you forgotten how anxious
you were to meet the lady?"</p>

<p>"Meet her!" Dusty Moth howled. "I
promise you I'd never go out of my way
to meet anybody that looked as she does&mdash;though
I might go a long distance to
avoid her."</p>

<p>Freddie Firefly glanced toward the picture.
But it had fallen face downward
upon the ground. And he did not take
the trouble to raise it.</p>

<p>"Well, you think Betsy Butterfly is
beautiful, don't you?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Indeed I don't! I think she's hideous,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_105" id="p_105">p. 105</a></span>
Dusty Moth shouted. "Never in all my
life have I been so deceived in a person."</p>

<p>"I don't understand how you can say
that," Freddie Firefly told him. "But I
suppose your idea of beauty may be different
from mine&mdash;and from many other
people's, too. Anyhow, I hope you'll get
your appetite back again."</p>

<p>"I don't know about that," said Dusty
Moth. "Just now I don't feel as if I ever
wanted to taste food again." A shudder
passed over him. And he covered his eyes,
as if to shut some terrible image from his
memory.</p>

<p>"I must leave you now," said Freddie
Firefly. "And please don't forget what
you promised me. You remember that you
said that if I'd show you a picture of Betsy
Butterfly you would stop pestering me
about her."</p>

<p>"Don't worry about that!" Dusty Moth<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_106" id="p_106">p. 106</a></span>
assured him bitterly. "I shall never mention
Betsy Butterfly's name again. I don't
want to think of her. But I'm afraid I
can never, never get her face out of my
mind.... I know&mdash;" he added&mdash;"I know
I shall see it in my dreams. And just
think how terrible it will be to wake at
midday, out of a sound sleep, with her
dreadful face and form haunting me!"</p>

<p>Freddie Firefly couldn't help feeling
sorry for the poor chap. But he could
think of nothing to do, except to show him
Betsy's portrait once more. So he started
to raise the picture from the ground, where
it still lay face downward. And the moment
Dusty Moth saw what he was about
he gave a frightful scream&mdash;and flew off
into the night.</p>

<p>"He's a queer one!" Freddie Firefly
mused. "Now, I've always thought Betsy
was a fine-looking&mdash;&mdash;" Just then his<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_107" id="p_107">p. 107</a></span>
eyes fell upon the picture for the first
time. And Freddie Firefly's mouth fell
open in astonishment.</p>

<p>So amazed was he by what he saw that
he tumbled right over backwards. And
then, scrambling to his feet, he wrapped
the rhubarb leaf hastily around the picture
and slung it across his back again.</p>

<p>"Jimmy Rabbit has made a terrible mistake!"
he groaned, as he started for the
duck pond.</p>

<hr class="sorta" />

<p>Back at the meeting place once more,
Freddie Firefly rushed up to Jimmy Rabbit
in great excitement.</p>

<p>"Do you know what you did?" he cried.
"You brought me the wrong picture. And
Dusty Moth has gone shrieking off into the
darkness, he was so disappointed. This is
not Betsy Butterfly's picture! It's some
dreadful-looking caterpillar. And when<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_108" id="p_108">p. 108</a></span>
I glanced at it just now, over in the orchard,
it sent a chill all through me."</p>

<p>For the time being Jimmy Rabbit said
nothing. At first he had seemed quite upset.
But before Freddie had finished
speaking he had begun to smile. And
then he unwrapped the picture once more
and leaned it against a stone, where the
moon's rays fell squarely upon it.</p>

<p>"You're mistaken," he informed Freddie
then. "This <i>is</i> a picture of Betsy Butterfly.
I painted it myself; and I ought to
know. As I explained last night, I made
it earlier in the summer; and as I said,
she has changed somewhat in the meantime.
But it's a very good likeness of her
as she was once."</p>

<p>"You mean&mdash;" gasped Freddie Firefly&mdash;"you
mean that Betsy Butterfly was once
an ugly caterpillar?"</p>

<p>"Why, certainly!" said Jimmy Rabbit.<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_109" id="p_109">p. 109</a></span>
"And so was Dusty Moth, for that matter.
Yes! he was a caterpillar himself,
once&mdash;and a much uglier one than Betsy,
if only he knew it.</p>

<p>"In fact," said Jimmy, looking at the
picture with his head on one side, "as
caterpillars go, Betsy Butterfly was a great
beauty, even at so early an age."</p>

<h3>THE SKIPPER</h3>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">In</span> Farmer Green's meadow there lived a
very nervous person called the Skipper.
He was a distant cousin of Betsy Butterfly's.
And since the two were almost exactly
the same age, they quite naturally
spent a good deal of time together.</p>

<p>The Skipper was of a dark, somber
brown shade. And it always seemed to the
gaily colored Betsy that he tried to make
up for his dull appearance by being extremely
lively in his movements. He was
forever skipping suddenly from one place
to another&mdash;a trick which had caused
people to call him by so odd a name.</p>

<p>Much as she liked this queer cousin,
Betsy often found his uncertain habit<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_111" id="p_111">p. 111</a></span>
somewhat annoying. It was not very pleasant,
when talking to him, to discover that
he had unexpectedly left her when she supposed
he was right beside her, or behind
her. If she had anything important to tell
him she frequently had to hurry after him.
And the worst of it was, once she had
overtaken him she never knew when he
would dart away again.</p>

<p>As the summer lengthened it seemed to
Betsy Butterfly that the Skipper grew
more flighty than ever. Once she had been
able to say a few words to him before he
went swooping off. But now&mdash;now she
could not even tell him that it was a nice
day without following her cousin at least
half an hour in order to finish her remark.</p>

<p>"You're becoming terribly fidgety,"
Betsy told him at last. "If you don't look
out you'll have nervous prostration&mdash;or I
shall, if you don't stop jumping about like<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_112" id="p_112">p. 112</a></span>
a jack-in-the-box. I advise you," she said,
"to see a doctor before you get any worse."</p>

<p>Of course, it must not be supposed that
Betsy Butterfly could say all that to her
cousin without going to a good deal of
trouble. As a matter of fact, she had to
follow him about the fields for two whole
days and travel several miles before she
succeeded in finishing what she wanted to
say to him.</p>

<p>"Why, I feel fine!" the Skipper cried.
"I don't need a doctor. I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He started to skip away from the wild
morning-glory blossom on which he had
perched himself. But Betsy caught him
just in time&mdash;and held him.</p>

<p>"Now, you listen to me!" she commanded.
"You're in a dangerous condition.
Some day someone will come to you
with an important message. And if you
go sailing off the way you do, how's he ever<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_113" id="p_113">p. 113</a></span>
going to tell the whole message until it's
too late, perhaps?"</p>

<p>"If it was good news it wouldn't hurt it
to keep it a while," the Skipper asserted
cheerfully. And he gave a quick spring,
with the hope of escaping from Betsy's
grasp. But she held him firmly by the
coat-tails.</p>

<p>"Suppose I wanted to warn you not to
go near the flower garden, because Johnnie
Green was waiting there for you with
his net, to capture you and put you in his
collection? You might be sorry, afterwards,
if you didn't sit still and listen to
me."</p>

<p>"That's so!" said the Skipper. "I
hadn't thought of that. I'd see a doctor
at once; but I don't know any."</p>

<p>"Go to Aunt Polly Woodchuck, under
the hill," Betsy Butterfly advised him.
"She's the best doctor for miles around."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_114" id="p_114">p. 114</a></span>So they went, together, to call on Aunt
Polly. The old lady looked at the Skipper
and shook her head. "I can't help
him," she said.</p>

<p>Betsy asked anxiously, "Is his trouble
catching?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed!" said Aunt Polly. "He
can't stay in one place long enough to give
it to anybody."</p>

<p>Well, after that Betsy saw very little
of her cousin the Skipper. But she did
not mind that, especially since she soon
made the acquaintance of a very agreeable
young gentleman, who dressed in the
height of fashion. He wore a swallowtail
coat every day. And the neighbors
all said that his manners were delightful.</p>

<p><i>He</i> never went skipping off while Betsy
Butterfly was talking to him.</p>
